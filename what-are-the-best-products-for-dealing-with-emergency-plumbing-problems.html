                                                    <p>When plumbing emergencies happen, there isn’t much you can do except call an expert plumber to fix the problem. However, there are some things you can do before that happens to make sure that your home doesn’t find itself with flooded crawl spaces, leaking faucets or collapsed toilet seats. Having these tools and products on hand can spare you from having to make unnecessary calls during your busy day. Knowing what to expect before the plumber arrives will help you avoid the stress and anxiety that often accompany unexpected plumbing problems. Here are some things you can do to be prepared for any plumbing emergency you might encounter in your home:</p><h2>Have a good working knowledge of your existing plumbing system</h2><p>Before a plumbing emergency ever happens, you need to know what is in your house and how it all works. This is especially important if you are dealing with older plumbing. Many plumbing codes have changed over the years and some older homes might not be up to code. If an emergency plumbing situation happens in one of these homes, you may not be able to call a plumber. Knowing what your plumbing system looks like can help you know which tools will be most effective in solving the problem. It also helps to know which parts of the system may be in need of repair or replacement. You can find most of this information online or in the owner’s manuals for your appliances.</p><h2>Check the water pressure in your home</h2><p>When your water pressure is too low, you may not be able to shut off the tap quickly enough to avoid scalding. This could be a sign of a bigger problem with your water supply or a regulator in your house that needs to be replaced. If you have a low-flow toilet, you may also want to consider installing an additional pressure regulator to ensure you always have enough pressure for the toilet to function properly. This can help you avoid having to call a plumber to fix the problem and deal with the stress of having an emergency while you wait for the plumber to arrive.</p><h2>Check and maintain your water tank and pipe work</h2><p>Even if your regulator is working properly, water might not be coming out of the tap at the right pressure if the water tank or pipe work near the house isn’t properly maintained. You can check the water tank for buildup of scale or sediment by using a scaler to clean the inside of the tank. If you find buildup or other signs of damage, you can have a plumber replace the tank. You can also clean the pipe work under the house using a cleaning solution and a cleaning brush to prevent buildup of scale inside the pipes and reduce the risk of water leaking from the pipes. You can clean the inside of the pipes with a pipe cleaning device if you can’t get to the pipes under the house. You can also clean them with a garden hose and a few household cleaning products.</p><h2>Have a plan in place for frequent use items like toilet seats</h2><p>If you have a toilet that is constantly clogged or a faucet that drips constantly, you may want to consider installing a water-saving toilet seat or faucet aerator to reduce the amount of time you have to spend on plumbing repairs. These items can help prevent costly repairs in the future by keeping waste materials from becoming stuck in your pipes. They also allow you to maintain water pressure during use by regulating the amount of water flowing through the faucet or toilet. These items are not foolproof and may need to be replaced from time to time, but they can help prevent more costly repairs in the future.</p><h2>Install a carbon filter to improve your water quality</h2><p>If you frequently have a problem with water that tastes bad or is cloudy, installing a carbon filter or filter system can help improve the water quality in your home. This can help protect your appliances from damage caused by dirty water and help you avoid having to spend time and money on frequent water quality repairs. Some homes are served by municipal water systems that have a high level of minerals. If you are experiencing problems with water quality, you may want to consider a water softening system or a reverse osmosis system to remove the minerals and make your water cleaner.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Plumbing is a necessary part of any home, but it can be an expensive one to replace or repair if it gets damaged. By keeping an eye out for signs that your plumbing system may need some attention and by having the right tools and products on hand to avoid a plumbing emergency, you can help keep your home operating smoothly and efficiently. Having a good working knowledge of your plumbing system before an emergency happens is also extremely helpful. Knowing what to expect before the plumber arrives can help you avoid the stress and anxiety that often accompany unexpected plumbing problems.</p>

                                            IA burst pipe is an emergency that requires quick action to stop water leaks from causing water damage to your property. Whether it's a burst pipe from your hot water system, a previously fixed pipe that has broken again, or a completely new burst. An emergency is an emergency.

                                            When the weather is very cold outside, let the cold water drip from the faucet served by exposed pipes. Running water through the pipe - even at a trickle - helps prevent pipes from freezing.

                                            Use epoxy putty or pipe putty as a temporary fix to a leaky pipe. Pipe putty is designed to harden at room temperature and seal the hole or crack.
