                                                    <p>When something goes wrong with your plumbing system, it can be an incredibly frustrating experience. Even for those who are well-trained and well-equipped for such problems, the feeling of being completely at a loss can be disconcerting. Fortunately, there are some general strategies for dealing with plumbing emergencies that apply to almost any scenario. In this article, we’ll discuss some of the most common plumbing emergencies and offer advice on how to deal with them effectively when they arise.- Read more...</p><h2>Know Your Systems and Their Limits</h2><p>The first step in dealing with any kind of plumbing emergency is to understand how the system in question works. Many plumbing systems are quite complicated and consist of many interconnected pipes, valves, fittings, and other components. Knowing how these things operate can help you determine how to proceed in an emergency and may even save time in the long run.For example, if you have a toilet that won’t flush, you might be tempted to simply turn off the main water supply and wait for help to arrive. However, in many cases, this won’t solve the problem and may even be counterproductive if the toilet has a siphon trap.- Get more info about different kinds of plumbing systems</p><h2>Turn Off the Water Supply</h2><p>If your home has a water supply shut-off valve, turn it off. This will prevent water from flowing through your pipes and help you avoid flooding. If your home doesn’t have a shut-off valve, the nearest valve can usually be found at the water meter. If you can’t shut off the water supply at the main water meter, there may be a valve for the supply line to the building in question.If you can’t shut the water off, you’ll need to find another way to prevent water from flowing freely in your pipes. You can temporarily plug off the pipe with a rag, sand, or any other material that will slow the flow of water.- For more info on water shut-off locations in your home, see our article: What is a water meter?</p><h2>Turn Off the Power to the Shut-off</h2><p>If you have a water meter that is equipped with a power source, you can turn this off to prevent the water from flowing freely. There are many different ways to shut off the power to your water meter, but the method will vary depending on the location and type of meter.- Get more info about locating water meters</p><h2>Call a Plumbing Professional</h2><p>If you’ve tried turning off the water supply and the power to the water meter and have been unsuccessful, you’re likely dealing with a more serious problem. In these cases, you should call a plumbing professional to come out and assist you.If you’ve been trying to fix the problem yourself and haven’t been able to solve it, it’s likely that you’ve exceeded your skill level. In this case, it may be best to call a professional to avoid further damage.- Read our article on how to hire a plumber</p><h2>Check for Leaks and Burst Pipe</h2><p>If you have a broken pipe, it’s likely that there has been a slow leak for some time. In this case, the best course of action is to turn off the water supply and let the water in the pipe evaporate. This will hopefully speed up the drying process and reduce the risk of mold and other contaminants growing inside.- For more info on locating broken pipes, see our article: 5 signs water is leaking from your toilet or other fixtures</p><h2>Pump Out Excess Water With a Float</h2><p>If you’ve determined that you have a broken pipe, you may also want to consider using a float-controlled pump. These are commonly used in commercial settings, but there are many types of float-controlled pumps that are also suitable for residential use.If you have a broken pipe, you can use one of these pumps to draw the water out of the pipe and reduce the flow through the damaged section. This will help prevent the pipe from overfilling and damaging the surrounding soil and foundation.- For more info about different types of float-controlled pumps, see our article: 5 ways to fix a broken toilet without a plumber</p><h2>Install a Manhole Cover in a PVC Pipe</h2><p>If you have a break in a cast iron or galvanized steel pipe, you can use a manhole cover to cover the break and redirect the flow. If you have a break in a PVC pipe, you should cover the break with a plastic cap.You can also use a plastic or metal cap to cover a break in a PVC pipe. You may need to patch the break or install a pipe repair sleeve in order to re-enforce the area.- For more information on repairing PVC pipes, see our article: How to patch a leaking PVC pipe</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>In many cases, it’s better to call a plumbing professional to handle a plumbing emergency. However, there are some basic steps that you can take before calling for help that can help you avoid additional damage. In most cases, turning off the water supply and the power to the water meter is the first thing that needs to be done.You should also try to identify the source of the problem and find any potential leaks. If you have a broken pipe, you can cover the break with a manhole cover or cap in order to redirect the flow.- To learn more about how to avoid plumbing problems in the first place, see our article: How to prevent plumbing problems</p>

                                            IA burst pipe is an emergency that requires quick action to stop water leaks from causing water damage to your property. Whether it's a burst pipe from your hot water system, a previously fixed pipe that has broken again, or a completely new burst. An emergency is an emergency.

                                            When the weather is very cold outside, let the cold water drip from the faucet served by exposed pipes. Running water through the pipe - even at a trickle - helps prevent pipes from freezing.

                                            Use epoxy putty or pipe putty as a temporary fix to a leaky pipe. Pipe putty is designed to harden at room temperature and seal the hole or crack.
