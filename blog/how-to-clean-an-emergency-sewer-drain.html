                    <p>An emergency sewer clean-out is a trap that is installed at the lowest point in the sewer line. It collects wastewater from the house and prevents it from entering the municipal sewer system. If there is a clog in the main sewer line, sewage will go into the trap instead and will back up into the house. A homeowner should clean out their sewer line once or twice a year to prevent this from happening.The job is not as difficult as it sounds. In fact, it’s not a job for the faint of heart and requires specialized equipment. It’s best left to a professional sewer cleaning contractor who has all the right tools and equipment. If you have ever tried cleaning out your sewer line without the right equipment, you will know what we are talking about. If you live in an older home, it may not have an accessible clean-out point. There are devices that can be installed at the lowest point in the sewer line to create an emergency sewer clean-out point.</p><h2>Why is your emergency sewer clean-out important?</h2><p>An emergency sewer clean-out is a trap that is installed at the lowest point in the sewer line. It collects wastewater from the house and prevents it from entering the municipal sewer system. If there is a clog in the main sewer line, sewage will go into the trap instead and will back up into the house. A homeowner should clean out their sewer line once or twice a year to prevent this from happening. An emergency sewer clean-out point can be accessed from a nearby creek, ditch, or backyard to prevent sewage from entering the municipal system and polluting an entire neighborhood.If there is a break in your sewer line and sewage is leaking into your backyard, the last thing you want is to get your neighbors’ attention and have them blame you for the problem. If you have an emergency sewer clean-out point, you can clean out the line and save face.</p><h2>How to clean an emergency sewer clean-out</h2><p>The first step in cleaning your emergency sewer clean-out is to turn off the water supply to the house. If water is leaking into your house, it can cause an increase in the pressure inside the home. Once the water supply has been turned off, you can safely clean out the sewer line and prevent water damage to your home.The first step in cleaning an emergency sewer clean-out is to locate the lowest point in the sewer line. This is typically in your backyard, but it could be anywhere depending on the layout of your property.Once you have found the lowest point, you will need to secure the area to prevent unwanted visitors from traipsing through your backyard and making your job more difficult. The easiest way to do this is to dig a trench about 2-3 feet deep and 3-4 feet wide. You can then line the trench with a thick layer of plastic sheeting or landscape fabric. Tie the trench off at the top with plastic ties or rope.You can also try to create a barrier by surrounding the area with sandbags or building a barrier using heavy machinery such as a backhoe or cement truck. If you want a barrier that can be taken down easily, consider using a PVC pipe frame.</p><h2>Step 1: Shut Off the Water Supply</h2><p>You will need to shut off the water supply to your home in order to properly clean out the sewer line. Shut off the water supply to your home by turning off the main water shut-off valve. In most cases, this will be a large valve that is located in the basement.If you have an in-ground well, you may also need to shut off the water supply to the well.</p><h2>Step 2: Prepare the Area</h2><p>Before you begin cleaning the sewer line, you will need to prepare the area. You will need to dig a trench that is deep enough to accommodate the length of your sewer line. The trench should be about 2-3 feet deep and 3-4 feet wide. You will also need to line the trench with a thick layer of plastic sheeting or landscape fabric to prevent the soil from caving in.You may also want to dig a secondary trench that is about 2 feet deep and about 6 inches wide. The secondary trench is where you will place your sewer cleaning equipment.If you have a high water table, you may need to install a subsurface sewage system that takes the sewage away from the sewer line. You can use sandbags or a trench to isolate the sewage system from the surrounding soil.</p><h2>Step 3: Introduce Chemicals to the Sewer Line</h2><p>Once you have dug the trench and have secured it, you can introduce chemicals into the sewer line to loosen up and break up any clogs that may be blocking your sewer line. You will need to use a product like Dr. Clean or a product that can be purchased at most home improvement stores. You can also use an eco-friendly product like vinegar or baking soda.</p><h2>Step 4: Snake the Drain</h2><p>Once you have introduced some chemicals to the sewer line, you can use a sewer cleaning device called a “snake” to break up the clog. There are many different types of sewer cleaning devices on the market, but the ones used for this job are called “J-Hook Snakes.” You can find these at most home improvement stores. You will also need to use a shovel to dig out the clog.The snake is a powerful device that is capable of clearing out a clogged sewer line in just a few hours. Once you have cleared out the blockage, you can re-introduce chemicals to the sewer line to break up any remaining clogs.</p><h2>Step 5: Use a Water Hammer to Break up the Clog</h2><p>If the clog is still not removed after using the snake, you can use a water hammer to break up the clog. A water hammer uses high pressure water to break up a clog that is too deep for the snake to reach. You will need to use the water hammer in conjunction with the chemicals that you have already introduced to the sewer line. The water hammer will break up the clog and allow the chemicals to attack the blockage from behind.Once the blockage is removed, you can re-introduce chemicals to the sewer line to break up any remaining clogs.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>A sewer clean-out is an essential part of any house or property. It is important to keep the sewer line clean and free of debris in order to prevent sewage from entering the municipal system. A clean-out can be used to break up a clog in the line and allow the water to flow freely again. A clean-out may also be used to repair a broken line.If you don’t have an emergency sewer clean-out, it can be difficult to clean a clog out. A sewer clean-out can help you to remove a clog and prevent sewage from entering the house.</p>
