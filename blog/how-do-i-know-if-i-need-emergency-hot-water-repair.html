                    <p>Hot water heaters are one of the most important appliances in your house, but unfortunately they also tend to break down at the worst times. If your hot water heater suddenly stops working, it can be an inconvenient and costly interruption to your family’s routine. It can also be a frustrating situation to try to fix. If left untreated, a broken water heater can lead to serious damage to your home and pose serious health risks to anyone living there. Fortunately, many water heater problems can be corrected with a simple repair. However, if your water heater is leaking or has a broken thermostat, those circumstances are more serious and may require a more extensive repair. To help you determine if your hot water heater requires emergency repair, we’ve outlined some of the most common problems and their solutions below:</p><h2>Why does my hot water tank need maintenance?</h2><p>Hot water heaters require regular maintenance to ensure they are working properly and efficiently. Most water heating systems will have their initial inspection and tune-up completed when they are installed and will require annual service to keep them running smoothly. Depending on where you live, it may be a good idea to contact a plumber to perform a routine inspection of your water heater. This will help prevent major problems in the future. If you live in a cold climate and experience a water shortage during the winter months, it may be a good idea to have your hot water heater inspected and serviced before the cold weather hits.</p><h2>How to know if your water heater needs repairs</h2><p>Water heaters are large and complex pieces of equipment that require specialized knowledge to repair. If you notice a sudden drop in hot water pressure in your home or notice a strange smell coming from your water heater, then you probably need to schedule water heater repairs as soon as possible. If you notice a significant drop in the amount of hot water your water heater is producing, then it is best to call a plumber as soon as possible. If your water pressure is low, this may be related to the flow rate of the water entering the water heater. If the pressure is too low, it can cause the water to back up into the pipes, faucets, and appliances throughout your home. A low flow rate can indicate that the water heater is old and needs repair or replacement.</p><h2>How to Fix a Hot Water Heater That’s Not Working</h2><p>If your hot water heater suddenly stops working, there are several factors to consider. First, you want to make sure the power is out. If the power is still on, then you can attempt to repair the water heater yourself, but it is much easier and safer to shut off the power before beginning repairs. Once you have shut off the power, you should check to make sure the water has been turned off at the main supply line going into the house. Next, you should open up the hot water heater and check to make sure the thermostat has not been damaged. If the thermostat has been damaged, you will likely need to replace it. Next, you should inspect the burner and make sure it is clean and free of debris. If the burner is damaged, you may need to replace it as well.</p><h2>Hot water heater problems and their solutions</h2><p>- Water heater runs constantly – This is a common problem for many water heaters. If the thermostat is dirty or the temperature dial is set too low, it can run constantly. To fix this issue, you will need to clean the thermostat and/or adjust the dial. If the burner is dirty, you will need to replace it.- Water pressure is too low - This problem can be caused by a faulty water main or a broken water pipe. If the water pressure is too low, it will be difficult to use a shower or flush the toilet. You can try to fix this issue by adjusting the water control valves.- Low water flow - This problem can be caused by a faulty pressure regulator or broken pipes. If the water flow is too low, it will be difficult to use a water dispenser or fill large laundry loads. To fix this problem, you will need to replace the pressure regulator or repair the broken pipes.- Water leaking from the wall - This problem can be caused by a faulty water pipe or a failed pressure regulator. To fix this issue, you will need to replace the water pipe or regulator. If the water leaking from the wall is coming from the floor, you will need to fix the broken pipe or replace the broken regulator.- Low water temperature - This problem can be caused by a damaged or clogged water heater tank or a faulty water temperature dial. To fix this issue, you will need to clean the tank or adjust the water temperature dial.- If your water is black or smells like gas - This is a serious issue and should be addressed immediately. If the smell is not coming from a gas water heater, it is likely coming from your water pipes.- If your water is discolored or brown - This issue can be caused by a faulty water pipe or chemicals being added to the water supply. To fix this issue, you will need to repair the broken water pipe or eliminate the chemicals from the water supply.</p><h2>How to Fix a Leaking Hot Water Heater</h2><p>Water leaking from a hot water tank can be a serious safety hazard and should be addressed immediately. If your hot water heater is leaking, you will need to shut off the water supply at the main water control valve. You can then remove the two rubber hoses connected to the water heater. The water in these hoses is usually very warm and can be used to flush the toilet. You can then shut off the water valve inside the tank and flush out remaining water with a garden hose. Once the tank has been drained, you will need to figure out what is causing the leak. If you are able to identify the source of the leak, you can then repair the water line by replacing the damaged section of pipe. If the source of the leak cannot be identified, you will need to replace the entire water heater.</p><h2>How to Fix a Frozen Hot Water Heater</h2><p>A frozen hot water tank is a serious issue and should be addressed immediately. If your hot water tank freezes, it is likely because the water in the tank has been sitting in the house for a long period of time. The water in your hot water tank should be changed every 60-80 days to avoid the buildup of harmful bacteria and chemicals. If the water in your tank has been sitting for longer than this, you will need to flush out the old water and replace the water with fresh, clean water. You can do this by shutting off the water supply at the main water control valve and flushing out the water with a garden hose. Once the tank has been flushed out, you can turn the water back on and enjoy clean, fresh water.</p>
