                                                    <p>The plumbing system of any home or office building has a few universal problems that anyone can relate to. With the exception of the occasional sink or toilet clog, we usually only have to deal with one or two common plumbing issues during the course of a year. However, there are some weird and wacky plumbing problems out there that only happen once in a blue moon. These are the types of situations that could literally send shivers down your spine if you ever had to deal with one in person. Luckily for us, we don’t have to go through these challenges personally because we have access to online plumbing help with all sorts of weird plumbing issues. Here are some of the most unusual plumbing problems you can find on the Internet right now:</p><h2>A house is growing a tree inside the walls.</h2><p>A home that’s growing a tree inside the walls sounds like something out of a Dr. Seuss book, but it’s actually a real phenomenon that happens from time to time. This issue is usually caused by root systems growing into the sewer line, but it can also happen when a tree root grows into a nearby home. In this situation, the only way to fix the problem is to remove the tree from the house and treat the sewage system to prevent future growth of the root system. This is a very difficult and expensive problem to resolve, so most people end up cutting the tree out of the wall instead.</p><h2>You got drunk one night and plugged the toilet with a piece of gum.</h2><p>This is another one of those hilarious Internet-only situations where you never want to be in that exact situation. On the other hand, it’s very satisfying to have a good laugh at the expense of people who got themselves into similar situations. What you do is go to the bathroom, eat a piece of gum, and then forget to flush it. You then proceed to throw up all over the toilet, plugging it with the gum and leaving the mess for someone else to clean up later. This is a very common and unfortunate problem among college students and drunks. You can clean a plugged toilet by first turning off the water supply and then using a toilet plunger to unplug the toilet. You can also try putting something like a coat hanger or broom handle down the toilet to try and unplug the toilet in a different way.</p><h2>Someone put rat poison in your toilet tank and flushed it away.</h2><p>This is another one of those Internet-only situations that is very scary and almost impossible to clean up. What you do is you go to the store, buy a toilet tank cleaner, clean out the toilet tank, put the tank cleaner back in the toilet tank, and then flush it all away. This is a very, very dangerous situation that could easily result in you or someone else getting very ill because of the poison. The only way to clean up this situation on your end is to remove the toilet tank, clean it out, and then put it back in. You can then flush away the poison along with the rest of the toilet tank cleaner.</p><h2>Your neighbours installed a black water tank in the backyard and are keeping an eye on it from the comfort of their living room.</h2><p>This is another hilarious Internet-only situation where you never want to be in that exact situation. On the other hand, it’s very satisfying to have a good laugh at the expense of people who got themselves into similar situations. What you do is go outside and see your neighbours sitting on the roof of their house with binoculars. You then proceed to walk back into your house and close the door, thinking that they don’t know about the black water tank. The neighbours then proceed to sit in their living room and have a good old-fashioned water fight with the black water tank. This is a very common and unfortunate problem among families with young children. The black water tank is a secondary sewage tank that is used to hold the water from your toilet and sinks while your home is being cleaned by a plumber. It usually sits in the backyard and can look like a small water tower of some sort.</p><h2>The neighbours have taken over your garden and are using it as a toxic waste dump.</h2><p>This is another hilarious Internet-only situation where you never want to be in that exact situation. On the other hand, it’s very satisfying to have a good laugh at the expense of people who got themselves into similar situations. What you do is go outside and see your neighbours sitting on your garden with shovels and spades. You then proceed to walk back into your house and close the door, thinking that they don’t know about your garden. The neighbours then proceed to dig up your garden and bury everything in it in their own personal toxic waste dump. This is a very common and unfortunate problem among neighbours who don’t know how to get along with each other. You can try to talk to them and explain that you love your garden and you want it back, but they probably won’t listen to you.</p><h2>Your neighbours have started an illegal cockroach farm in your backyard that you didn’t know about.</h2><p>This is another hilarious Internet-only situation where you never want to be in that exact situation. On the other hand, it’s very satisfying to have a good laugh at the expense of people who got themselves into similar situations. What you do is go outside and see your neighbours sitting at the kitchen floor with a bunch of cockroaches. You then proceed to walk back into your house and close the door, thinking that they don’t know about the cockroach farm. The neighbours then proceed to collect cockroaches from the kitchen floor and put them in a bowl with some grass and an apple tree branch as a lid. This is a very common and unfortunate problem among neighbours who don’t know how to get along with each other. You can try to talk to them and explain that you love your backyard and you want it to stay clean and sterile, but they probably won’t listen to you.</p><h2>You are visiting a friend in their house, and they have an out-of-control garden in their backyard that they don’t know how to take care of.</h2><p>This is another hilarious Internet-only situation where you never want to be in that exact situation. On the other hand, it’s very satisfying to have a good laugh at the expense of people who got themselves into similar situations. What you do is go to your friend’s house, visit them, and then walk back into your house, thinking that they don’t know about their garden. The garden has grown wildly out of control, and it now covers the backyard. You then proceed to sit down at the kitchen table and try to talk to your friend about the out-of-control garden. This is a very common and unfortunate problem among neighbours who don’t know how to get along with each other. You can try to talk to them and explain that you love their backyard, but they probably won’t listen to you.</p><h2>Your neighbours have started an illegal pig

                                            IA burst pipe is an emergency that requires quick action to stop water leaks from causing water damage to your property. Whether it's a burst pipe from your hot water system, a previously fixed pipe that has broken again, or a completely new burst. An emergency is an emergency.

                                            When the weather is very cold outside, let the cold water drip from the faucet served by exposed pipes. Running water through the pipe - even at a trickle - helps prevent pipes from freezing.

                                            Use epoxy putty or pipe putty as a temporary fix to a leaky pipe. Pipe putty is designed to harden at room temperature and seal the hole or crack.
